Please re-run the program in occurance of the following extremely rare cases:
- In case no data is loaded: Due to slow internet or more than specified time taken by the website elements to load, this might have occured.
- In case of error in loading a link: The program will not close and still extract information from the existing home page.
- In case very small number of information pieces are loaded: The program extracts information in a random fashion in each run. Even if this happens, it is normal. It is likely to extract more information in the next run.

Please note that these cases are extremely rare and take place under very specific conditions. It is highly unlikely that someone would encounter these. But even in such a case, please consider re-running the program to see proper results.
